- [x] Version control with comprehensive commits

## üéØ Next Steps: Animation Production

### 1. Style Frame Generation (Midjourney)
For each major scene, generate style frames:
```bash
# Use the story descriptions in 07_story_development/
# Focus on key visual moments from each act
# Maintain consistent anime-inspired aesthetic
```

### 2. Prompt Creation for Vertex AI
Transform story beats into Veo 3 prompts:
```bash
# Start with opening_kaladin scene
python3 tools/master_pipeline.py --test-scene opening_kaladin

# Then run full pipeline when ready
python3 tools/master_pipeline.py --full-pipeline
```

### 3. Video Generation Workflow
```bash
# Monitor progress
python3 tools/pipeline_monitor.py --dashboard

# Submit individual clips
python3 tools/vertex_manager.py \
  --project-id stormlight-short \
  --scene "clip_01_title" \
  --prompt "Sweeping aerial shot across alien Roshar landscape..." \
  --duration 6
```

### 4. Assembly in Flow
- Import generated clips to Flow
- Apply transitions and timing adjustments
- Export for audio integration

### 5. Audio & Final Cut
- Add orchestral score
- Sound effects for magic and environment
- Final color grading and export

## üìä Production Estimates

### Time Estimates
- Style frame generation: 2-3 days
- Vertex AI video generation: 3-5 days (29 clips)
- Flow assembly: 2-3 days
- Audio integration: 2-3 days
- **Total**: 9-14 days for complete trailer

### Cost Estimates (720p)
- 29 clips √ó average 5.5 seconds = 159.5 seconds
- Cost: 159.5 √ó $0.0375 = ~$6 for initial generation
- Estimate 2-3 iterations for refinement: ~$18-24 total

## üöÄ Launch Commands

```bash
# Start with the interactive menu
./launch.sh

# Key options:
# 1) Monitor Dashboard - Track progress
# 2) Run Test Scene - Test individual clips
# 3) Run Full Pipeline - Generate all clips
# 6) Health Check - Verify readiness
```

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Always use dry-run first** to test prompts without cost
2. **Monitor costs** via the dashboard (warning at $50)
3. **Save all generated content** - sync to GCS regularly
4. **Document iterations** - update prompt ledgers
5. **Test clips individually** before batch processing

## üé≠ Creative Direction Reminders

- **No Shardblades** - Focus on Surgebinding and spren bonds
- **Dynamic timing** - Vary clip lengths for natural pacing
- **Character focus** - Kaladin's journey is central
- **Epic scope** - Show the scale of Roshar
- **Series hook** - End with promise of more

**The story is written. The tools are ready. Time to bring Roshar to life!**

May the Stormlight be with you! ‚ö°üå™Ô∏è
