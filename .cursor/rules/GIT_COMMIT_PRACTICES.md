# Git Commit Practices for Stormlight Short Project

## Commit at Major Milestones

Always create comprehensive Git commits when reaching significant checkpoints:

### When to Commit
- After implementing major features
- When completing a set of related functionality
- Before making significant architectural changes
- After successful test runs
- When documentation is updated

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Types
- `feat`: New feature implementation
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Test additions/modifications
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

#### Example Structure
```
feat: Complete Stormlight Short AI video production pipeline

Major milestone: Full automation pipeline for AI-generated video content

## ðŸŽ¬ Core Components Implemented

### Infrastructure (X lines of Python)
- Component descriptions
- Key features
- Technical details

### Key Features
- âœ… Feature 1
- âœ… Feature 2
- âœ… Feature 3

This provides [impact/benefit of the changes]
```

### Best Practices
1. **Be Descriptive**: Include what, why, and impact
2. **Use Emojis**: For visual organization (ðŸŽ¬ ðŸ›  âœ… ðŸ“š ðŸš€)
3. **Include Metrics**: Lines of code, tests passing, performance gains
4. **List Components**: Break down what was added/changed
5. **Explain Benefits**: How this helps the project

### Git Commands Sequence
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Create detailed commit
git commit -m "feat: Your comprehensive message"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Or use gh CLI for additional features
gh pr create --title "Feature: X" --body "Description"
```

### Automated Commits
Consider using the automation tools to trigger commits:
```bash
# After major operations
python3 tools/automation_orchestrator.py --commit-milestone "Description"
```

Remember: Good commit messages are documentation for future you and collaborators!
